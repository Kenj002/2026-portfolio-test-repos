                <p>Hello, I'm Kenji Pontanar Patiño.</p>
                <p>We get a lot of rain here, but that never really gets in the way of staying positive and motivated.</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm an In-plant Trainee in Computer Engineering Technology, and I'm really excited about the opportunity to put my skills to the test in a real-world setting.</p>
                <p>My main goal as an intern is to gain hands-on experience and dive deep into solving technical problems. I want to build a solid foundation by working on real projects and learning from professionals who have been in the field for years. I believe this experience will help me grow as an engineer and prepare me for the challenges of the tech world.</p>
                <p>I'm passionate about understanding how technology works behind the scenes, whether it's hardware or software. I'm always eager to tackle problems and find solutions that make a difference, and I'm hoping to expand my skills in areas like troubleshooting, system design, and development.</p>
                <p>Along with gaining technical skills, I'm also looking to develop my ability to think critically and creatively when faced with challenges. Working in a dynamic environment, I know there will be opportunities to improve both my technical and interpersonal skills, and I'm excited about growing within the organization.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, my goal is to not just learn but to contribute, to be someone who can bring value to the team while continuing to grow as a professional. I'm looking forward to learning more, getting hands-on with the latest technologies, and making the most of this opportunity.</p>
